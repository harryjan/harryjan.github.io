            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <img src="assets/forhire.jpg" alt="For Hire" class="main-image">
            <p>As you may know, I’ve finished my role at AtkinsRealis as Director, Software Development & Cloud Enablement, managing the Platform Engineering team to architect and deliver fantastic secure services and platforms to enable Product Teams to deliver to (largely) National Security, Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) and High-Tech Manufacturing clients.</p>
            
            <p>Being based in Deutschland now, it's a new market to explore but luckily I've landed in the German equivalent of Silicon Roundabout in the foothills of the Alps.</p>

            <h3>What I do</h3>
            <p>The best way to describe what I do is that I work at the intersection of Business Strategy and Technical Delivery, aligning both so Investments make sense and the Delivery Teams are set up for success.</p>
            <p>I prefer to work at the leadership level, building, coaching and enthusing teams doing the doing whilst I set the conditions for their work to continue and prosper. Laying the train track ahead of the train. I am too optimistic to be a purist Project Manager.</p>
            <p>I have worked in Product Manager/Owner roles many times and love to get my teeth into interesting problems but tend to get frustrated with legacy ways of working and want to fix those! To unblock what I see as blocking excellent work for me and all.</p>
            
            <h4>The types of things I’ve done in roles that I’m really good at:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixing broken things. Teams/processes/programmes that aren’t delivering or are struggling to get going.</li>
                <li>Starting things; winning business cases, building new teams and handing over the day to day running. I am not a “business as usual person”. I need to see progress in what I do, not "turn the handle".</li>
                <li>Coaching/Mentoring delivery teams and senior leaders, around Product Strategy, Software Delivery, and Product Operations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Specific things I can help with:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Product/Digital/Engineering maturity reviews</li>
                <li>Where and how to get started with transformation in Product/Software Engineering</li>
                <li>Product Prioritisation at a strategic level</li>
                <li>Interim leadership roles</li>
                <li>Programme management</li>
                <li>Team health checks</li>
                <li>Project/Process reviews & realignment</li>
                <li>Coaching (both delivery and exec teams) in Product, Software Delivery and Operations</li>
                <li>Training in agile, user centred design</li>
                <li>Working in the open</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My guiding principles</h3>
            <p>My definition of digital is: Applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet-era to respond to people's raised expectations.</p>
            <p>Digital does not equal IT or technology on its own.</p>
            <p>I’m driven by delivering public good and solving interesting challenges in sectors that impact people's lives, not optimising click-through rates by an additional 5%.</p>
            <p>Delivery, delivery, delivery. I’m not interested in theory, academics or endless pontificating. People need things to get better FAST. There’s a lot at stake.</p>

            <h3>The unique things about me</h3>
            <p>I see the world in patterns. I know when something is going to fail a long time before any leading indicators provide “hard evidence”. My extensive experience helps me to guide situations and avoid pitfalls and failures before they happen. I know how bureaucracy works and how to work around it or through it. I bring different ways of thinking about and tackling challenges, I don’t stay nicely in a box.</p>
            
            <h3>Get in touch</h3>
            <p>I’m available to start work from October but I am really keen to have chats with people who might have challenges that I can help with.
