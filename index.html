            </div>

            <p>After a successful tenure as <strong>Director of Software Development & Cloud Enablement</strong> at AtkinsRealis, I am seeking new challenges. My role involved building and leading the Platform Engineering capability to enable the delivery of high quality products to our clients in National Security, Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), and High-Tech Manufacturing sectors.</p>
            
            <p>Now based near <strong>Munich</strong>, I am excited to explore opportunities in the German market and beyond.</p>

            <h3>What I do</h3>
            <p>The best way to describe what I do is that I work at the intersection of <strong>Business Strategy</strong> and <strong>Technical Delivery</strong>, aligning both so Investments make sense and the Delivery Teams are set up for success.</p>
            <p>I prefer to work at the <strong>leadership level</strong>, building, coaching and enthusing teams doing the doing whilst I set the conditions for their work to continue and prosper. Laying the train track ahead of the train. I am too optimistic to be a purist Project Manager.</p>
            <p>I have worked in <strong>Product Manager/Owner</strong> roles many times and love to get my teeth into interesting problems but tend to get frustrated with legacy ways of working and want to fix those! To unblock what I see as blocking excellent work for me and all.</p>

                <li><strong>Starting things</strong>; winning business cases, building new teams and handing over the day to day running. I am not a “business as usual person”. I need to see progress in what I do, not "turn the handle".</li>

            <h3>My guiding principles</h3>
            <p>My definition of <strong>digital</strong> is: Applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet-era to respond to people's raised expectations.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital does not equal IT</strong> or technology on its own.</p>
            <p>I’m driven by delivering <strong>public good</strong> and solving interesting challenges in sectors that impact people's lives, not optimising click-through rates by an additional 5%.</p>
            <p><strong>Delivery, delivery, delivery</strong>. I’m not interested in theory, academics or endless pontificating. People need things to get better FAST. There’s a lot at stake.</p>

            <h3>The unique things about me</h3>
            <p>I see the world in <strong>patterns</strong>. I know when something is going to fail a long time before any leading indicators provide “hard evidence”. My extensive experience helps me to guide situations and avoid pitfalls and failures before they happen. I know how bureaucracy works and how to work around it or through it. I bring different ways of thinking about and tackling challenges, I don’t stay nicely in a box.</p>
            
            <h3>Get in touch</h3>
            <p>I’m available to start work from <strong>October</strong> but I am really keen to have chats with people who might have challenges that I can help with.
