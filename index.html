            <h3>What I do</h3>
            <p>I work at the intersection of <strong>Business Strategy</strong> and <strong>Digital Technical Delivery</strong>, aligning both so Investments make sense and the Delivery Teams are set up for success.</p>
            <p>I tend to work at the <strong>leadership level</strong>, owning the strategy, building, coaching and enthusing teams. However I will take on <strong>Product Manager/Owner</strong> roles if the business/technical challenge is sufficiently interesting, but tend to get frustrated with legacy ways of working and want to fix those on the way!</p>

            <h4>The types of things I’ve done in roles that I’m really good at:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixing broken things</strong>. Teams/processes/programmes that aren’t delivering or are struggling to get going.</li>
                <li><strong>Starting things</strong>; winning business cases, getting products from 0 to V1.0 and building new teams. I am not a “business as usual person”. I need to see progress in what I do, not "turn the handle".</li>
                <li><strong>Coaching/Mentoring</strong> delivery teams and senior leaders, around Product Strategy, Engineering management, and Product Operations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Specific things I can help with:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Management</strong> - Going from 0 to 1 on Proof of Concepts, MVPs and strategic new builds fast to capture opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>Product Portfolio Management</strong> - Where/how should you invest in product(s) or cut your losses?</li>

                        <li>Coaching/Mentoring technical teams navigating Business concepts & politics (and vice versa)</li>
                    </ul>

            </ul>

            <h3>My guiding principles</h3>
            <p>My definition of <strong>digital</strong> is: Applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet-era to respond to people's raised expectations.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital does not equal IT</strong> or technology on its own.</p>
            <p>I’m driven by delivering <strong>public good</strong> and solving interesting challenges in sectors that impact people's lives, not optimising click-through rates by an additional 5%.</p>
            <p><strong>Delivery, delivery, delivery</strong>. I’m not interested in theory, academics or endless pontificating. People need things to get better FAST. There’s a lot at stake.</p>
