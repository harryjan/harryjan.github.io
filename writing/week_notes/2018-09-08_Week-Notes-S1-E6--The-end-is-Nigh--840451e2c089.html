+            <h4>But what’s next?</h4>
+            <p>My last ‘real’ working week for a while has been both a long time coming (8 months) and also a sudden surprise, creeping up and pouncing on me like a lioness stalking her prey.</p>
+            <p>It’s been an odd sort of time, handing over delivery and advising team mates moving onto new projects on approaches to delivery and alternate points of view with this door closing behind me. The last 18 months in consultancy has been a whirlwind of new ideas, relationships and contexts which will take some time to percolate down to the core lessons learnt; a blog for the future I hope.</p>
+            <p>A repeated question I’ve been fielding is ‘what’s next when you get home’. My response has been that I don’t want to think about that until closer to the time, but it has triggered some general thinking about career satisfaction; what I’ll look for when I return home.</p>
+            <p>I’ve written before on my simplistic ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@harryjan/why-is-team-ownership-of-why-critical-to-effective-delivery-3a266c087ea4?source=linkShare-8b5f64b2463c-1536413172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why, What, How, When’ model </a>of delivery and how roles and responsibilities can be split between these questions.

+            <h4>The Mission</h4>
+            <p>To perform beyond the bounds of the day to day rat race to earn the requisite salary for your lifestyle you’ve got to be passionate about the core purpose of the organisation, its mission and its vision. You should awake every (or most…) days with enthusiasm to deliver value to your users, customers and constituents.</p>
+            <h4>The Job</h4>
+            <p>Whilst believing in the mission is critical, if you don’t enjoy what you’re actually doing on a day to day basis you’ll never have the impact on the mission your investment or choice in the organisation deserves. Therefore you need to be satisfied with your day to day routine; the tasks you undertake, the development of your skills and the sense you are adding value towards achieving the mission.</p>
+            <h4>The Culture</h4>
+            <p>Lastly we don’t work/deliver in a vacuum, we’re part of teams, departments and divisions. Therefore we need to be satisfied with how the organisation works together to deliver work to impact the mission. How easy is it make decisions, deliver value from idea to impact and make your users, customers and stakeholders smile.</p>
+            <p>So in the search for my next role I plan to structure my thinking and questions around these three concepts; can the organisation or client prove to me that they have a mission worth investing my time in, a job that is challenging and a culture which enables me to deliver effectively.</p>
