     of delivery and how roles and responsibilities can be split between these questions. Similarly you can use these as a structure for thinking about career satisfaction, which is a ‘life’ project in itself.

     The Mission
    </h4>
    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f6c4" name="f6c4">
     To perform beyond the bounds of the day to day rat race to earn the requisite salary for your lifestyle you’ve got to be passionate about the core purpose of the organisation, its mission and its vision. You should awake every (or most…) days with enthusiasm to deliver value to your users, customers and constituents.
    </p>
    <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="5c3d" name="5c3d">
     The Job
    </h4>
    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="bec9" name="bec9">
     Whilst believing in the mission is critical, if you don’t enjoy what you’re actually doing on a day to day basis you’ll never have the impact on the mission your investment or choice in the organisation deserves. Therefore you need to be satisfied with your day to day routine; the tasks you undertake, the development of your skills and the sense you are adding value towards achieving the mission.
    </p>
    <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="33ed" name="33ed">
     The Culture
    </h4>
    <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing" id="5b10" name="5b10">
     Lastly we don’t work/deliver in a vacuum, we’re part of teams, departments and divisions. Therefore we need to be satisfied with how the organisation works together to deliver work to impact the mission. How easy is it make decisions, deliver value from idea to impact and make your users, customers and stakeholders smile.
