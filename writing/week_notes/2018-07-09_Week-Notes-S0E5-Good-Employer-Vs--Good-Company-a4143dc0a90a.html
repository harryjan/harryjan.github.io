            <h4 name="5dcb" id="5dcb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle">The difference between an environment which cares for you, and one you care about.</h4><p name="7405" id="7405" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Ive been thinking about of the difference between a ‘good employer’ and a ‘good company’ recently.</p><p name="8377" id="8377" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m of the opinion that the terms can be mutually exclusive, and here’s why.</p><h4 name="a4b1" id="a4b1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">On Management</h4><p name="57ce" id="57ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A good employer will manage their teams to keep them productive; pressure at times, reason and fairness at others.</p><p name="4321" id="4321" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A good company will lead their teams to keep them engaged and self-motivated to manage their own energy and output levels.</p><h4 name="dc89" id="dc89" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">On Prioritisation</h4><p name="d934" id="d934" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A good employer will ensure their teams are profitable, meeting the immediate needs of the business and its clients demands.</p><p name="100c" id="100c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A good company will ensure their teams are structured and executing to take winning positions delivering what customers need given market opportunities.</p><h4 name="5bf0" id="5bf0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">On Innovation</h4><p name="4310" id="4310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A good employer will provide space to breath and innovate as perks to distract from BAU client delivery.</p><p name="51db" id="51db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A good company will create the environment where innovation is not a choice, its a necessity to delivery value to its customers.</p><h4 name="e6ea" id="e6ea" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">On Scaling</h4><p name="e338" id="e338" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A good employer will scale headcount; managing supply and demand to ensure hours are reasonable and management is reasonable.</p><p name="1352" id="1352" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A good company will scale outcomes; using Capex investments to bet on the future and scale ‘the system’ against these.</p><h4 name="7b7a" id="7b7a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">On Strategy</h4><p name="dc49" id="dc49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A good employer will execute against a fixed vision and strategy to deliver on shareholder expectations.</p><p name="897c" id="897c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">A good company will question the vision and strategy on a daily basis; making targeted investments where assumptions change and new opportunities are presented.</p><p name="b4c0" id="b4c0" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">None of this is to say that working for a good employer is not valuable; I’d actually say that depending on your lifestyle it can be a sensible choice to prioritise working for ‘just’ a good employer at times. Yet in my opinion, once you have worked for a good company it’s hard to go back to &#39;business as usual’.</p>
