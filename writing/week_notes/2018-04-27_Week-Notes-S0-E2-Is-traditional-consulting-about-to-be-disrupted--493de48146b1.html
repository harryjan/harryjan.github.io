            <p class="originally-published"><em>Originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/@harryjan/is-traditional-consulting-about-to-be-disrupted-493de48146b1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a> on April 27, 2018.</em></p>
            
            <h4 name="930e" id="930e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle">Searching for the big fours moat</h4><p name="8a1a" id="8a1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Having working in management consulting for a little while now, I’m consistently amazed at the willingness of clients to pay the extravagant fees of the consulting industry. How have such defensible margins grown when the core product offerings of these firms (brains on seats) appears to be an indefensible business model?</p><p name="3bc5" id="3bc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Are the margins ripe for disruption? Based on a brief analysis of the typical traditional consultancy’s practices vs. the ‘moats’ we might use to judge the defensiveness of a product business it would suggest so.</p><h4 name="a0c7" id="a0c7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Economies of scale</strong></h4><p name="8b34" id="8b34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The ‘as is’ model relying almost entirely on warm bodies to scale services as demand grows is innately unscalable. As client demand increases marginal costs for adding N+1 services grows at minimum linearly or even worsen exponentially with time as overheads grow to support increasing headcount.</p><h4 name="3a49" id="3a49" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Network Effects</strong></h4><p name="c9dc" id="c9dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This does exist on a limited basis in theory through sharing of people and knowledge across sectors on the supply side; but there is seemingly limited intentional horizontal integration in the market across clients on the demand side. Services are usually designed as siloed per client bespoke offerings rather than benefiting from growth in a value ecosystem as demand for a particular service grows.</p><h4 name="e0dc" id="e0dc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Intellectual property (Technology)</strong></h4><p name="9ead" id="9ead" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Given the client-centric model with most IP staying with the client of a service offering and little incentive to expend capital to develop technological replacements for tasks which will disrupt their traditional offerings (brains on seats), I’ve seen few examples were IP would act as a moat to substitution with a competing consulting service.</p><h4 name="0080" id="0080" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">High switching costs</strong></h4><p name="92d9" id="92d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Given how government and BigCos operate the big four and similar are protected as a limited pool of organisations who have the scale to bid &amp; win for the framework contracts which provide a ‘limited’ licence to print money if they can be resourced (see economies of scale).</p><p name="b847" id="b847" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The large tender costs of the procurement process acts as a moat in itself; a firm needs the financial scale to expend the significant resource to simply compete, and once the contract is signed clients are usually unable to re-tender for financial and political reasons without significant due cause.</p><p name="53db" id="53db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hence the focus on such contractual models and margins can blind many firms from other opportunities deemed less lucrative, and makes them increasingly reliant on the continuance of the procurement model into the future.</p><h4 name="2803" id="2803" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Brand &amp; Customer loyalty</strong></h4><p name="fc64" id="fc64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Yes, clients can like a consultancies people and their work, with personal trust built up between individuals and the client leading to a firms name on a CV adding a level of assurance to justify the daily rates. Yet it is also the weakest given the business models dependence on human resources who by their nature are fickle over the longer term.</p><h4 name="98ff" id="98ff" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">An alternative: Scaled VC-Advisory services</h4><p name="28db" id="28db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">So what are the alternatives to this model? Opportunities are endless, yet those which match the traditional margins enjoyed without significant change will be rare.</p><p name="67f6" id="67f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Disruptive firms such as <a href="https://medium.com/u/375d0eb2fa14" data-href="https://medium.com/u/375d0eb2fa14" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="375d0eb2fa14" data-action-value="375d0eb2fa14" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Cloudreach</a> offer one example; offering a model which integrates professional services with technology to a far greater extent than traditionally used.</p><p name="e865" id="e865" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another courtesy of <a href="https://medium.com/u/df45fd4a749d" data-href="https://medium.com/u/df45fd4a749d" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="df45fd4a749d" data-action-value="df45fd4a749d" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Andreessen Horowitz</a> is to integrate professional services with the financial services which already exist as separate business units within the Big4. Scaling out A16z’s model of investment with targeted professional advice and services at the outset could be interesting.</p><p name="7220" id="7220" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back in my Startup days I used to say;</p><blockquote name="90e0" id="90e0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“<strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">I don’t care about the outcomes of a client project unless it contributes to the wider product (ney business) strategy”</strong>.</blockquote><p name="42eb" id="42eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The former add value to the immediate client and revenue in the short term. The latter adds value to all clients and revenue stretching into the future.</p><p name="278f" id="278f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">With management consulting in its current state; I’m sorry to say I see too much of the latter and too little of the former, with disruptive technology enabled firms nipping at their heals, ready for clients to wake up to the possibilities offered at price points which can’t be touched by the Big4.</p>
